# DeepPhasePick
DeepPhasePick is a method for detecting and picking seismic phases from local earthquakes based on highly optimized convolutional and recurrent deep neural networks.

## 1. Install

...

### 2. Sample Data

#### 2.1 Continuous seismic data

DeepPhasePick is applies on continuous seismic data stored in the archived directory structure in **archive/YY/NET/STA/CH**
This archive can be updated with new data...

### 3. Optimized trained Models

Best performing trained models and other relevant results obtained from the hyperparameter optimization are stored in the following directories: 

**detection** -> phase detection related results,

**picking/P** -> P-phase picking related results, and


**picking/S** -> S-phase picking related results.

### 4. DeepPhasePick Worflow

1) Reading trained models and other relevant results from hyperparameter
optimization.

2) Definition of parameters...

3) .
