### 2. Sample Data

#### 2.1 Continuous seismic data

DeepPhasePick is applies on continuous seismic data stored in the archived
directory structure in **archive/YY/NET/STA/CH**
This archive can be updated with new data...

### 3. Optimized trained Models

Best performing trained models and other relevant results obtained from the
hyperparameter optimization are stored in **detection**, **picking/P** and
**picking/P** directories for the respective tasks.
